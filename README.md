# Firebase Database Quickstart
This app provides a useful starting point for building your own web app using Firebase, Google's cloud backend as a service.

The example app implements the Firebase [QuickStart Database example](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-nodejs/tree/master/database), which is a backend that works with a simple, front-end, [social blog app](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-js/tree/master/database).

It uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to provide the ability to log in with Google Auth, create posts with messages as well as comment on others posts, star ones you like and receive an email notification whenever someone adds a new star.
