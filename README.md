# Intake on GoMix

Forked from this:
https://firebase-quickstart.gomix.me/

and this:

https://github.com/staywokeorg/intake

For detailed setup instructions, see `setup.md`.

## Todo
- [x] Import icon fonts
- [x] Make success page look better
- [x] Make the entire firebase transaction happen on the Node side instead of the frontend to make it more secure
- [ ] Bring back the option for social auth
- [ ] Even if there's only a single topic selected, make it an array for consistency
- [x] Figure out why web.js@submit is timing out
